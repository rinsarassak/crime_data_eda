# <h1 align="center">📊 Crime Data Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project</h1>

## <h2>📈 Project Overview</h2>
This project aims to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on crime data from 2020. The dataset provides detailed records of criminal activities across various regions, including information on crime types, victim demographics, and case statuses. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights that can inform public safety strategies, assist law enforcement agencies, and support policymakers in developing effective crime prevention initiatives.

## <h2>📝 Dataset Description</h2>
The dataset contains the following key attributes:
- **🌎 DR_NO**: Unique crime report number
- **🗓️ DATE_RPTD**: Date the crime was reported
- **🗓️ DATE_OCC**: Date the crime occurred
- **📊 AREA**: Area number where the crime occurred
- **🏞️ AREA_NAME**: Name of the area where the crime occurred
- **📊 RPT_DIST_NO**: Reporting district number
- **🔒 PART_1-2**: Part 1 or Part 2 crime classification (Part 1 crimes are more serious)
- **🔮 CRM_CD**: Crime code
- **📊 CRM_CD_DESC**: Description of the crime
- **👶 VICT_AGE**: Age of the victim
- **♂️/♀️ VICT_SEX**: Sex of the victim
- **🏳️ VICT_DESCENT**: Descent of the victim
- **🏢 PREMIS_CD**: Premise code indicating the type of location
- **📍 PREMIS_DESC**: Description of the premise
- **🗡️ WEAPON_USED_CD**: Weapon used code
- **🛡️ WEAPON_DESC**: Description of the weapon used
- **🛡️ STATUS**: Status of the case (e.g., Open or Closed)
- **📊 STATUS_DESC**: Detailed description of the status
- **📍 LOCATION**: Geographic location where the crime occurred

## <h2>🌟 Objectives</h2>
The primary objectives of this EDA project are:
- 🔹 To analyze crime distribution across different regions and identify hotspots
- 🔹 To explore correlations between demographic factors and crime types
- 🔹 To assess the frequency and types of crimes by date and location
- 🔹 To examine weapon usage trends and their impact on crime severity
- 🔹 To investigate the relationship between crime types and case resolution status

## <h2>🛠️ Tools and Technologies</h2>
- Python (with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for interactive analysis
- Geospatial visualization tools for mapping crime patterns

## <h2>💡 Project Workflow</h2>
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Data type corrections
   - Standardizing date formats

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing crime trends over time
   - Identifying regional crime patterns
   - Analyzing demographic factor

3. **Insights and Recommendations:**
   - Highlighting crime-prone areas
   - Suggesting strategic interventions for crime prevention

## <h2>📊 Expected Outcomes</h2>
- Clear visualizations of crime trends and patterns
- Recommendations for improving community safety based on data-driven findings
